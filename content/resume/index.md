I am a dedicated iOS developer with a comprehensive background in web development, enriched by a deep understanding of design principles, specifications, and standards. I began my career in web development in 2002 and have since worked with leading internet companies, including [Tudou.com](https://tudou.com) and [Ctrip.com](https://ctrip.com).

My journey into iOS development began in 2011 through self-learning. Over the past years, I’ve honed my skills in Objective-C and, since 2014, have predominantly used Swift to program iOS apps. My experience also includes roles at respected firms such as [Modern Media Co., Ltd.](https://modernmedia.com.cn), [yqb.com](https://www.yqb.com), [No NDA Inc.](https://www.nonda.co), [MiHoYo.com](https://www.mihoyo.com) and [PixelForce](https://pixelforce.com.au). Each opportunity has been a stepping stone that has allowed me to develop a versatile skill set and a keen insight into iOS development.

In my spare time, I enjoy contributing to the open-source community. I was an early advocate for CocoaPods, where I helped numerous third-party libraries to adopt this dependency manager. I've also developed several open-source projects like [LTMorphingLabel](https://github.com/lexrus/LTMorphingLabel), widely utilized in iOS applications, and [SwiftyMenu](https://github.com/lexrus/SwiftyMenu), a handy Finder extension available for free.
