## Log Data

This app does not collect any log data. No information about your usage, errors, or device is recorded or transmitted.

## Security

## Links to Other Sites

This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me.

I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Children's Privacy
